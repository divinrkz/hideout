### Concept Note

Navigate a maze of Caltech buildings, avoiding seekers at every turn. Outsmart them, hide cleverly, and reach your target unscathed.

  
  

## GAMEPLAY
This is a visual hide and seek game with a constructed maze with some of caltech buildings as target locations. The hider is on a mission to reach the target building of which the name will be displayed on the screen for example “Caltech Hall”. The hider will go through the maze using arrow keys and the spacebar will be a turbo for faster speed. The hider must reach the target location within 2 minutes. The hider will be troubled by seekers whose role is to tag the hider and spoil their mission. After every 30 seconds in the game, the number of seekers inside the maze will be increased by one. The hider’s goal is to get to the defined building without being tagged by the seekers, if the hider is tagged the game will be over. If the hider gets to the target without being tagged a screen with two option will be displayed either “Start new mission” or “End the game”**

## DISASTER RECOVERY

<u>Shallon Kobusinge</u>: If I fall behind, before we start implementing I plan to explain our game design to my section TA “Max” such that incase I get stuck he can be the second hand I go to for clarification or ideas on how to push back along with consulting my teammate for any issue that might arise.

  

<u>Divin Irakiza</u>: Falling behind is not on my bucket list. However, misfortunes do happen. When this happens, I plan to consult my teammate on what to do inorder not to get her stuck.

  

<u>Joint Statement</u>: We have put most of our important features in Week 1 and Week 2 so that when unforeseen circumstances happen, there is some time in Week 3 to catch up. We are also eager to start the next task once one is finished in order to be ahead of time as a way to be in the safe zone when disaster occurs. We are planning to use a task management tool (Jira or Trello or Pivotal Tracker) for a more collaborative experience.
