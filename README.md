## DISASTER RECOVERY
<u>Shallon Kobusinge</u>: If I fall behind, before we start implementing I plan to explain our game design to my section TA “Max” such that incase I get stuck he can be the second hand I go to for clarification or ideas on how to push back along with consulting my teammate for any issue that might arise. 

<u>Divin Irakiza</u>: Falling behind is not on my bucket list. However, misfortunes do happen. When this happens, I plan to consult my teammate on what to do inorder not to get her stuck. 

<u>Joint Statement</u>:  We have put most of our important features in Week 1 and Week 2 so that when unforeseen circumstances happen, there is some time in Week 3 to catch up. We are also eager to start the next task once one is finished in order to be ahead of time as a way to be in the safe zone when disaster occurs. We are planning to use a task management tool (Jira or Trello or Pivotal Tracker) for a more collaborative experience.
